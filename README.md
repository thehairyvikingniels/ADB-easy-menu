# ADB-easy-menu
This is meant to be an easy way to use the android debug bridge. There is a list of batch files in the batched folder. Each one does what the title says (If not comepleatly clear there is a little discription in the changelog file). There is no need for additional software to run this, it's a unzip-and-play program. Easy right?
